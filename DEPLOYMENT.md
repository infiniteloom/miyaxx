Since you asked if I can help connect to GitHub, here's what we can do together:

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Create a GitHub Account
- Go to https://github.com/join
- Sign up with your email
- Verify your account

#### 2. Choose Your Deployment Method

**EASIEST METHOD - GitHub Desktop:**

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in
3. Click "File" â†’ "Add Local Repository"
4. Select this folder: `/Users/leathomas/Desktop/Miyaxx website`
5. If prompted to create a repository, click "Create Repository"
6. Click "Publish repository" button
7. Choose a name: `miyaxx` 
8. Click "Publish Repository"

**TERMINAL METHOD (if you prefer):**

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/leathomas/Desktop/Miyaxx website"

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Miyaxx website"

# Go to github.com and create a new repository named 'miyaxx'
# Then run these commands (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/miyaxx.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

#### 4. Wait 1-2 Minutes

GitHub will build and deploy your site. You'll see a message like:
"Your site is ready to be published at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/miyaxx/"

#### 5. Visit Your Live Site! ðŸŽ‰

Your website will be live at:
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/miyaxx/`

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain like `www.miyaxx.com`:

1. Buy a domain from a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In your GitHub repository settings â†’ Pages:
   - Enter your custom domain
   - Click "Save"
3. In your domain registrar's DNS settings:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues, let me know! I can help troubleshoot.

Common issues:
- **404 error**: Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- **Video not playing**: Check that the video file is committed to GitHub
- **Site not updating**: Try doing a "hard refresh" (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
